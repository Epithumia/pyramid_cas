----------------
    - deleted unused files and templates
    - deleted unused .ini files (all info is in the README file)
    - removed the pyramid_cas.callback.get_user functionality: the module should
        not burden itself with this since Pyramid already offers several ways to
        do it easily
    - some documentation
    - logging
    - After a successful authentication, it's now possible to redirect back to a
        page based on the request.GET "next" parameter
